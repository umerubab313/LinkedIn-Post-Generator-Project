# LinkedIn-Post-Generator-Project
#📌 Project Overview

This project is a LinkedIn Post Generator built using a Large Language Model (LLM) to help users create professional, engaging LinkedIn posts based on a given topic, tone, or prompt.

The goal of this project was to understand how Generative AI models can be integrated into real-world applications while keeping the system simple, modular, and explainable.

##🧠 How It Works

User provides a topic or brief idea

The input is sent to an LLM via API who is also provided with data of users previous posts so that it can understand writing style

The model generates a structured, professional LinkedIn post

Output is displayed to the user

##🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Large Language Model (LLM) API

Streamlit (for UI)

VS Code

##🎯 Key Learnings

How to work with LLM APIs

Prompt design for structured content generation

Building simple GenAI applications

Understanding limitations and responsible use of LLMs

##📌 Note

This project focuses on using a pre-trained LLM for content generation and does not involve training a custom machine learning model.

##🚀 Future Improvements

Tone customization (formal, casual, technical)

Hashtag optimization

Post length control
